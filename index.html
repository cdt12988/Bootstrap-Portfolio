					<p>Able to reconcile a balance sheet as well as write a program that could do it for him, Cody Thompson is an accountant turned developer who spends his free time adventuring with his wife, cuddling with his two dogs (or is that the other way around?), and generally learning new arts and skills.  He loves to write, play guitar, and try new things.</p>
					<p>After six years as an accountant, Cody decided to pursue a longtime dream of his to become a developer and learn to code.  While maintaining his day job, he took to learning all he could at night.  Luckily, Cody has a very patient and understanding wife who supported him every step of the way and encouraged him to chase those dreams -- all while carrying their first child!</p>
					<p>A couple of months after starting out, Cody made some great progress learning the basics of several languages, including PHP with MySQL, where he developed a few projects, including a simple <a href="https://github.com/cdt12988/widget_corp" target="_blank">Content Management System</a>.  He then decided to enroll in a coding bootcamp to help him learn as much and as quickly as possible.  It was there that he learned to make several of the projects that can be seen on his <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio page</a>.</p>
					<p>Cody now hopes to apply all of the knowledge and skills he has developed into the professional world, looking for opportunity wherever it may strike.  He's very proud of the work he has done and eagerly looks forward to figuring out what his future entails!</p>
					<p>If you would like to reach out to Cody and send him a message, you can do so <a href="contact.html">here</a>!  Also, feel free to follow him on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cody-thompson-ab1352165/" target="_blank">linkedin</a>.</p>
